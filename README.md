# Movie_ranking

This app will allow users to create a ranked list of movies.
This started out as soomething I was doing with movies I had seen.
I was ranking each movie from best to worst, and maintianing this list on a spread sheet.
I was unaware of letterbox at the time.
I am doing this a way to practice react.

DONE:

1. Set up server
2. User registration
   2.1) Determine what is required for user
   2.2) basic user interface for sign up and login (react)
3. Profile Registration
   3.1) Created backend for profile creation
   3.2) log out
4. In phase 1 I decide to treat the movie list as an attribute for the profile, This may get changed later. For now movie object is nixed
5. Profile Registration
   5.1) create front end for profile creation and edit

TODO:
