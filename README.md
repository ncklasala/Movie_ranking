# Movie_ranking

This app will allow users to create a ranked list of movies.
This started out as soomething I was doing with movies I had seen.
I was ranking each movie from best to worst, and maintianing this list on a spread sheet.
I was unaware of letterbox at the time.
I am doing this a way to practice react.
